Project Description

Calculates each person's share of a bill, optionally including tax and tip.  Handles uneven splits and tracks who paid what.  Provides a summary of amounts owed and can settle up debts.


The Problem statement

[What ridiculous problem are you solving?] Sharing expenses among a group, like after a meal or trip, can be cumbersome and prone to errors.  Manually calculating individual shares, especially with varying contributions and added taxes/tips, is time-consuming and can lead to disagreements.  Tracking who owes what and settling up can also be a hassle.

The Solution
A split bill app simplifies expense sharing by allowing users to input the total bill amount, the number of people splitting it, and individual contributions (if any).  The app automatically calculates each person's share, including taxes and tips, and provides a clear breakdown of who owes what.  It can also track payments made and help settle up balances, eliminating the need for manual calculations and minimizing the risk of misunderstandings.

[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]

Our project, the FairShare App, is designed to track expenses, what you are owed, and what you owe. It is specifically created to help manage money matters between groups of friends, colleagues, etc.

The first page of the app is the starting page, which leads to the home screen.

At the top is a dropdown menu where you can select the user you want to track.

On the home screen, you will see all the expenses tracked by the users on your device.

The first button on the top right allows you to add more people, and the second button on the top right lets you create groups with the people on your device.

The first button on the bottom right takes you to the add expenses screen, where you can track more expenses.

The second button on the bottom right leads to the transaction screen, where it shows what the user is owed and how much they owe someone else.

On the home screen, you can also delete expenses, and the changes will be reflected on the transactions page as well.
